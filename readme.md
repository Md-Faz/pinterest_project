A complete full stack pinterest project, in this project we will only focus on the backend and not frontend, we will be using node js, express js, mongo db, mongoose, multer, passport, expres generator, etc.,

This is a simplest pinterest app, not focused on ui but focused on learning backend, more improvements to be done later...

Features:
1. Login/register
2. Profile creation
3. Uplaoding images/pins
4. Viewing pins of all users.



Moving ahead more features and improvements needs to be implemented:

1. add messege, notification when wrong userid or password entered,
2. add prompt when there is no account found or registered,
3. add icons when there are no images uploaded yet, like a camera icon to profile page and board icon on baords and pin icon on pins etc.,
4. implement concept of baoprds and then add pins inside it
5. add empty transparent board image when there is nothing in the account
6. add a seperate page which displays the pin, title, description, user info when clicjked on an individual pin
7. improve overall ui and design of the website
8. as a major update implement usage of react instead of ejs files.
